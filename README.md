# UCL-Quant-Methods
Source code of all assignments for UCL's "PUBL0055: Introduction to Quantitative Methods" course.

A range of statistical models (e.g. linear regression, logistic regression, two-way fixed effects) are used in these assignments to analyse data on a range of public policy issues including the effects of socioeconomic inequality on health outcomes for children, the impact of rain on voter turnout, and the determinants for support for the European Union.
